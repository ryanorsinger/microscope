//Instantiate a new collection for Posts
//To Var Or Not To Var?
// In Meteor, the var keyword limits the scope of an object to the current file.
// Here, we want to make the Posts collection available to our whole app, which is why we're not using the var keyword.
Posts = new Meteor.Collection('posts');
